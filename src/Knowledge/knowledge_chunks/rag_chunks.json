    "text": "In recent years, the field of power electronics has experienced a large growth due to\nconfluence of several factors. The controller in the block diagram of Fig. 1-1 consists of\nlinear integrated circuits and/or digital signal processors. Revolutionary advances in mi-\ncroelectronics methods have led to the development of such controllers. Moreover, these\nadvances in semiconductor fabrication technology have made it possible to significantly\nimprove the voltage- and current-handling capabilities and the switching speeds of power\nsemiconductor devices, which make up the power processor unit of Fig. 1-1. At the same\ntime, the market for power electronics has significantly expanded. Electric utilities in the\nUnited States expect that by the year 2000 over 50% of the electrical load may be supplied\nihrough power electronic systems such as in Fig. 1-1. This growth in market may even be"
